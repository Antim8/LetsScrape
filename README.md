## 1. Overview
 This is our final project for the course Scientific Programming in Python of the University Osnabr√ºck. Our goal is to compare the range of restaurants in different german cities available on Lieferando (www.lieferando.de). To gather the data we use Selenium (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) and matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org) to visualise the results. 

 ## 2. Installation 
 ### General requirements
 <ul>
 <li>Working python enviroment with version >= python 3.7 (https://www.python.org) </li> <br>
 <li>Chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)<br> Install the chromdriver which fits your brower version. You can see the chrome version under Settings>About Chrome. </li> <br>
 </ul>

 ### Installation process
 Open a terminal in the project folder and enter <br>

     $ pip -r install requirements.txt

  You need to change the PATH in scraper.py depending on your operating system. 

  #### For Mac
  Attention: You might need to give special permissions to your chromedriver to work. 
  In line 17 and 18 it should look like this:
  ```Python 
 PATH = "PATH TO YOUR DRIVER"  
 driver = webdriver.Chrome(PATH)  
  
  ```
  #### For Windows 
  In line 17 and 18 it should look like this:
  ```Python 
 PATH = "PATH TO YOUR DRIVER"  
 driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=PATH)  
  
  ```
  #### For Ubuntu Linux 

  ## 3. How to use the program
  Run lets_scrape.py 

     $ python lets_scrape.py

  and then follow the dialoge. As a result there should appear up to two pdf files in the Project folder.

  ### Troubleshooting and Remarks


   #### Entering adresses <br>
   <ul><li>Lieferando might not find the city. You may use an actual adress or add " Hbf" to the city name.</li> <br>
   <li>For cities which might occur multiple times in germany, you may enter the zip code to the city name. </li></ul>
